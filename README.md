# Topperworld_Task_1

The objective of the unit converter application project in
Android development is to create a versatile and user-friendly
app that allows users to convert various units of

REQUIREMENT

measurement, such as length, weight, temperature, and more.
The app aims to provide a convenient and efficient tool for
users to convert values between different units on their
Android devices.
User Interface (UI) Design: The app should have an intuitive and visually appealing UI
design that facilitates easy input of values and selection of conversion units.
Unit Conversion Functionality: The app should support a wide range of unit conversions,
including length (e.g., meters to feet), weight (e.g., kilograms to pounds), temperature (e.g.,
Celsius to Fahrenheit), and other commonly used measurements.
Conversion Accuracy: The app should provide accurate and precise conversions
to ensure reliability and usefulness.
Customization: Users should have the option to customize the app's settings,
such as selecting preferred units, language, and theme.
Responsiveness: The app must be responsive and work smoothly on different
Android devices, accommodating various screen sizes and orientations.

STAGES

Define the scope of the unit converter app and the supported units of
measurement.
Plan the app's UI design and user flow.
Create wireframes or mockups to visualize the app's layout and design
UI Development:
Implement the UI design using XML layout files and Android Studio's layout editor.
Ensure the UI is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes.
Unit Conversion Logic:
Develop the unit conversion algorithms to handle various conversion types
accurately.
Implement data structures to store unit conversion ratios and formulas
User Input and Calculation:
Implement user input functionality to allow users to enter values for conversion.
Perform calculations based on the selected units to display accurate conversion
results.
Customization Options:
Develop settings screens to allow users to customize the app's preferences, such as
selecting preferred units.
